                                    which I bought in the supermarket on the way to Mt.Chai Secret. That was interesting!

                                    the path next to "Cape Coffee", walking about 5 minutes, and I saw a wonderful U-shaped sea erosion arch. I took lots of pictures with the sea erosion arch when the sea was at low tide.

                                    salty cheese, which tasted so healing that eliminated tiredness throughout the day. The iron plate noodles was stir-fried, quite flavorful, with seasonal vegetables, and a soft-boiled egg. The surface of the cheese
                                    was burnt, bringing out a burnt aroma. The whole was very stringy with consistency, soft taste. The store, which was located at No. 32, Wufu 4th Road, Yancheng District, Kaohsiung City, its meal was very delicious and
                                    wonderful!

                                    taking the shower, and that relieved my stress!

                                    other animals from all over the world in the park, and I therefore took a lot of photos.

                                    In the afternoon, I went to have some special meal. I saw a special store that was called “Women’s dumplings”, which was located at No. 113-2, Qixian 3rd Road, Kaohsiung. There were only female waiters, and the meal was great, too! After finishing the
                                    lunch, I went to The Pier-2 Art Center to see variety of artworks. It was unused warehouse before, but through the cooperation with artists and the government, it became a famous attraction in Kaohsiung. I also took
                                    lots of photos. Because Hamasen Station was nearby, after finishing the journey to The Pier-2 Art Center, I went to the Hamasen Taiwan Railway Museum. The ticket was about 200 dollars, and there were stories inside
                                    the museum.

                                    Today I came to Kaohsiung for a day trip near NSYSU. Breakfast was indispensable in a beautiful morning. Our breakfast choice was the 40-year-old wharf omelet. The special old-fashioned flour omelette tasted soft and fragrant , the omelette was thick
                                    and full of weight. Watching the aunt struggling to fry the powder in the big pot was also healing.

                                    The next stop I came to the Pier-2 Art Zone. The Pier-2 Art Zone had three main parts, namely Dayong Warehouse and Penglai Warehouse And the Dayi Warehouse, each had different characteristics, but the same level of excitement, although the Pier 2 Pagoda
                                    of the Dayong Warehouse looked different, it was still high. However, the landscape above was breath-taking. The port, Cijin and the 85th Building were all in sight. The installation art of the Penglai installation
                                    also floated in my mind. The oversized suitcases, speakers and robots were all impressive. I found it novel, and the installation art of Dayi Warehouse called Peeing Boy was made of mosaic collage walls and faucets.
                                    The faucets sprayed water from time to time. I didn’t know that I was almost sprayed when I took pictures. These three were my refutation 2 . The impression of the Art Special Zone was that the Pier-2 Special Zone was
                                    very large, and every visitors spent half a day visiting it.

                                    Then I went to eat Wanquan Meatballs at noon. This restaurant had been in business for 60 years. It was cheap and delicious. The meatballs were soft and sticky but tasted great. The store made its own sauce and garlic, and the overall taste was even better.
                                    The rice cake was Q-bomb. After eating enough, I went to the nearby Fuquan Snowflake Ice Shop to eat ice to cool off the heat.

                                    After filling my stomach, I first came to the secret place of Chaishan. A section of the road was considered a small exercise after dinner. After arriving, it seemed to have come to a paradise. It had not been contaminated by the world at all. The beauty
                                    of nature, strange rocks, a straight coastline and the endless sea, how wonderful it would be to live in this place, It was a pity that the people around me brought me back to reality in an instant. All in all, when

                                    was seven thirty in the morning, so I decided to have a breakfast first. I ate casually because I wanted to have a space to eat more when I went to another place.After finishing the breakfast, I went to Former British
